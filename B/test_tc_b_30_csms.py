Test case name      Cold Boot Charging Station - Pending/Rejected - SecurityError
Test case Id        TC_B_30_CSMS
Use case Id(s)      B02/B03
Requirement(s)      B02.FR.09, B03.FR.07

Requirement Details:
    B02.FR.09: The Charging Station has received a BootNotificationResponse with status Pending AND the Charging Station sends a RPC Framework: CALL message that is NOT a BootNotificationRequest or a message triggered by one of the following messages: TriggerMessageRequest,
        Precondition: The Charging Station has received a BootNotificationResponse with status Pending AND the Charging Station sends a RPC Framework: CALL message that is NOT a BootNotificationRequest or a message triggered by one of the following messages: TriggerMessageRequest, GetBaseReportRequest, GetReportRequest.
    B03.FR.07: B03.FR.03 AND Charging Station sends a message that is not a BootNotificationRequest
        Precondition: B03.FR.03 AND CSMS sends a message that is not a response to a BootNotificationRequest from Charging Station
System under test   CSMS

Description         The booting mechanism allows a Charging Station to provide some general information about the
                    Charging Station to the CSMS on startup AND it allows the Charging Station to request whether
                    it is allowed to start sending other OCPP messages. The CSMS may respond to the
                    BootNotificationRequest with status Pending or Rejected. During this state, the Charging
                    Station is not allowed to send RPC Framework: CALL message that is NOT a BootNotificationRequest
                    or in case of status Pending, a message triggered by one of the following messages:
                    TriggerMessageRequest, GetBaseReportRequest, GetReportRequest.
Purpose             To verify whether the CSMS is able to handle unauthorized messages from the Charging Station by
                    responding with a SecurityError.

Prerequisite(s)     The CSMS is configured to first respond to a BootNotificationRequest with status Pending or Rejected.

Test Scenario
1. The OCTT sends a BootNotificationRequest with reason PowerUp
2. The CSMS responds with a BootNotificationResponse (status: Pending or Rejected)
3. The OCTT notifies the CSMS about the current state of all connectors.
4. The CSMS responds with RPC Framework: CALLERROR: SecurityError.

Tool validations
* Step 2:
    Message: BootNotificationResponse
    - status Pending OR Rejected
