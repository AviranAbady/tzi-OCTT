State               EnergyTransferStarted
System under test   CSMS
Description         This state will simulate that there is transferring energy between the EV and EVSE of the simulated
                    Charging Station.
Before
    Configuration State: N/a
    Memory State: N/a
    Reusable State(s):
        If State is NOT Authorized then execute Reusable State Authorized
        If EVConnected is true, then proceed to part 2
        Else proceed to part 1.

Scenario (Part 1)

1. The OCTT notifies the CSMS about the status change of the connector.
    Message: StatusNotificationRequest
        - connectorStatus is Occupied
    Message: NotifyEventRequest
        - trigger is Delta
        - actualValue is Occupied
        - component.name is Connector
        - variable.name is AvailabilityState

2. The CSMS responds accordingly.
3. The OCTT sends a TransactionEventRequest With triggerReason is CablePluggedIn transactionInfo.chargingState is
   EVConnected evse.id <Configured evseId> evse.connectorId <Configured connectorId> eventType is Updated
4. The CSMS responds with a TransactionEventResponse


Scenario (Part 2)

5. The OCTT sends a TransactionEventRequest With triggerReason is ChargingStateChanged
   transactionInfo.chargingState is Charging eventType is Updated
6. The CSMS responds with a TransactionEventResponse

Post condition
    State is EnergyTransferStarted
    EVConnected is true
