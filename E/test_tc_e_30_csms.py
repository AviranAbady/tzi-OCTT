TC_E_30 - Check Transaction status - Transaction with id ongoing - without message in queue
Use case: E14 | Requirements: E14.FR.02, E14.FR.05
E14.FR.02: The Charging Station receives a GetTransactionStatusRequest with a transactionId AND The transaction with that transactionId has not stopped yet The Charging Station’s response SHALL have ongoingIndicator = true. E. Transactions
    Precondition: The Charging Station receives a GetTransactionStatusRequest with a transactionId AND The transaction with that transactionId has not stopped yet
E14.FR.05: The Charging Station receives a GetTransactionStatusRequest with a transactionId AND It has no transaction-related messages to be delivered about the transaction with that transactionId The Charging Station’s response SHALL have messagesInQueue = false.
    Precondition: The Charging Station receives a GetTransactionStatusRequest with a transactionId AND It has no transaction-related messages to be delivered about the transaction with that transactionId
System under test: CSMS

Purpose: Verify the CSMS can request the status of queued TransactionEventRequest messages from a
specific transaction by sending GetTransactionStatusRequest with a transactionId. The CS responds
that there are NO messages queued belonging to the ongoing transaction with the requested id.

Before: Reusable State EnergyTransferStarted

Test sequence:
1. CSMS sends GetTransactionStatusRequest with transactionId
2. CS responds with ongoingIndicator=true, messagesInQueue=false

Configuration:
    CSMS_ADDRESS     - WebSocket URL of the CSMS
    BASIC_AUTH_CP    - Charge Point identifier
    BASIC_AUTH_CP_PASSWORD - Charge Point password
    VALID_ID_TOKEN   - Valid idToken value
    VALID_ID_TOKEN_TYPE - Valid idToken type
    CONFIGURED_EVSE_ID   - EVSE id (default 1)
    CONFIGURED_CONNECTOR_ID - Connector id (default 1)
    CSMS_ACTION_TIMEOUT - Seconds to wait for CSMS message (default 30)
