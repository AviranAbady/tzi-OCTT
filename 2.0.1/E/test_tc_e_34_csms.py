TC_E_34 - Check Transaction status - Without transactionId - without message in queue
Use case: E14 | Requirements: E14.FR.06, E14.FR.08
E14.FR.06: The Charging Station receives a GetTransactionStatusRequest without a transactionId The Charging Station’s response SHALL NOT have ongoingIndicator set.
    Precondition: The Charging Station receives a GetTransactionStatusRequest without a transactionId
E14.FR.08: The Charging Station receives a GetTransactionStatusRequest without a transactionId AND It has no transaction-related messages to be delivered. The Charging Station's response SHALL have messagesInQueue = false.
    Precondition: The Charging Station receives a GetTransactionStatusRequest without a transactionId AND It has no transaction-related messages to be delivered
System under test: CSMS

Purpose: Verify the CSMS can request the status of queued TransactionEventRequest messages by
sending GetTransactionStatusRequest without a transactionId. The CS responds that there are NO
messages queued.

Test sequence:
1. CSMS sends GetTransactionStatusRequest (transactionId omitted)
2. CS responds with ongoingIndicator omitted, messagesInQueue=false

Configuration:
    CSMS_ADDRESS     - WebSocket URL of the CSMS
    BASIC_AUTH_CP    - Charge Point identifier
    BASIC_AUTH_CP_PASSWORD - Charge Point password
    CSMS_ACTION_TIMEOUT - Seconds to wait for CSMS message (default 30)
