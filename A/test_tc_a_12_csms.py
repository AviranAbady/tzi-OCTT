Test case name      Update Charging Station Certificate by request of CSMS - Success - V2G Certificate
Test case Id        TC_A_12_CSMS
Use case Id(s)      A02 & F06
Requirement(s)      A02.FR.11 & F06.FR.01

Requirement Details:
    A02.FR.11: Upon receipt of a SignCertificateRequest AND It is able to process the request The CSMS SHALL set status to Accepted in the SignCertificateResponse.
        Precondition: Upon receipt of a SignCertificateRequest AND It is able to process the request
    F06.FR.01: In the TriggerMessageRequest message, the CSMS SHALL indicate which message(s) it wishes to receive.
System under test   CSMS

Description         The CSMS is able to request the Charging Station to update its charging station certificate using the
                    TriggerMessageRequest message.

Purpose             To verify if the CSMS is able to request the Charging Station to update its V2G Certificate.

Prerequisite(s)     The CSMS supports ISO 15118.

Test Scenario
1. The CSMS sends a TriggerMessageRequest
    With requestedMessage SignV2GCertificate
    EVSE <EVSE (having an seccId) returned in the GetReportResponse or omitted in case none is available>
2. The OCTT responds with a TriggerMessageResponse
    With status Accepted
3. The OCTT sends a SignCertificateRequest
    With csr Generated CSR based on:
    - <Configured Country>
    - <Configured Organization>
    - <Configured OrganizationalUnit>
    certificateType V2GCertificate
4. The CSMS responds with a SignCertificateResponse
5. The CSMS sends a CertificateSignedRequest
6. The OCTT responds with a CertificateSignedResponse
    With status Accepted

    Note(s): Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are repeated for all returned seccIds

Tool validations
* Step 1:
    Message: TriggerMessageRequest
    - requestedMessage SignV2GCertificate

* Step 4:
    Message: SignCertificateResponse
    - status Accepted

* Step 5:
    Message: CertificateSignedRequest
    - certificateChain <Certificate generated from the received CSR from step 3 and signed by the V2G Root or
      SubCA certificate from the configured V2G certificate chain>

    NOTE: The OCTT will validate the certificate, but if the following validation fail, the testcase will NOT FAIL,
    because generating the certificate is probably not be done by the CSMS.

    - The key must be at least 224 bits long.
    - The received certificate must be transmitted in the X.509 format encoded in Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format.
